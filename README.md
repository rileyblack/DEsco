Disco party light real-time embedded system that pulsates LEDs to the rhythm of the ambient or AUX-connected music source.

## Design
Code written in low-level C througth the [Intel FPGA Monitor](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/fpga-academic/tools.html) onto a [DE-10](https://fpgacloud.intel.com/devstore/board/de10-standard/) standard computer. Necessary I/O components including an audio-in auxillary port, LED lights, and 7-segment mode display all configured to the Altera Cyclone V (ARM Cortex A9 + FPGA).
